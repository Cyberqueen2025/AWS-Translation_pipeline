**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

> **TRANSLATION PIPELINE -- AWS TERRAFORM DEPLOYMENT**
>
> **This project automates the deployment of a serverless translation
> pipeline on AWS using Terraform. It leverages:**

- **Amazon S3 for storing input/output JSON files**

- **AWS Lambda (written in Python with Boto3) to process translation
  jobs**

- **Amazon Translate for automated language translation**

- **S3 Event Notifications to trigger Lambda execution on file upload**

- **Lifecycle Policies to manage bucket storage efficiently**

> **Key Features**

- **Fully Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform**

- **Lambda packaged as lambda_function.zip**

- **IAM roles and policies for secure service access**

- **Auto-triggered processing from S3 input bucket**

- **Translated output written back to a separate S3 bucket**

1.  **Terraform Apply -- Translation Pipeline**

This screenshot shows a successful terraform apply execution for the
translation_pipeline project.

**Resources Created**

- **IAM**: lambda_policy: Custom IAM policy for Lambda execution,
  translator role and policy attachment

- **Lambda**: translate Lambda function deployed from
  lambda_function.zip, Permission added to allow S3 to invoke the
  function.

- **S3**: Two buckets: bucket025-input and bucket00-output, Lifecycle
  rules created for both buckets, Notification configured to trigger
  Lambda on object creation.

<!-- -->

- Total resources deployed: **10 resources added**, **0 changed**, **0
  destroyed**, Lifecycle rule creation took \~59 seconds, Clean deploy
  with no errors.

2.  JSON Input File for Amazon Translate

> **Overview**:\
> The screenshot shows a test_input.json file open in VS Code under the
> project *AUTO SCALING FORCE*. The file defines structured inputs for a
> translation task, including source and target languages and the text
> to be translated. The file is designed for use with **Amazon Translate
> and lambda**, supporting automated and event-driven translation
> workflows.

3.  AWS Lambda Function -- *asg-translator*\
    This screenshot shows the **AWS Lambda console** for the function
    named asg-translator. The function appears connected to an **S3
    trigger**, indicating it's event-driven, processing files uploaded
    to an S3 bucket.

4.  S3 Upload Confirmation for test_input.json\
    This screenshot captures the **successful upload** of
    test_input.json to the S3 bucket asg-bucket205-input via the AWS
    Management Console. The file is recognized as a JSON object
    (application/json, 272.0 B) with a status of "Succeeded," confirming
    proper ingestion.

5.  Output JSON from Amazon Translate via Lambda.\
    This JSON output shows translated results generated by a Lambda
    function integrating with **Amazon Translate**. Each entry logs the
    original English text, its translated counterpart, and the language
    pair used.

6.  Terraform Destroy Execution for AWS Translation.

This image captures the terminal output from running terraform destroy
within a VS Code workspace titled translation_pipeline. The command
initiates teardown of AWS infrastructure managed by Terraform. The plan
includes destroying the IAM policy, lambda_policy, confirming
Terraform's role in gracefully deprovisioning resources at the end of
the pipeline lifecycle.![](./media/media/image6.png){width="6.5in"
